We will create a text file here.
Whenever anyone have some new idea about how we could implement ai chess which not necessarily is as strong as a grandmaster but plays more like , how a non-professional chess player may play , this idea will be illustrated by him on this text file.
Then all the team members will discuss on the efficiency , correctness and other factors about this new idea.
After discussion, we will compile all the ideas to come up with a totally new approach to implement ai chess into a single document.
The text file will also have ideas which we don't use in our final algorithm , we will mention in the same text file the reason behind why we decided to not include it in our final algorithm.
